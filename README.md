Bugs I faced

1. Bable module was erroring out saying there was a missing semicolon within index.tsx even though that wasn't true. the fix was Adding .babelrc fixed the issue because it gave Babel the necessary instructions to handle TypeScript in addition to JavaScript and React (JSX), making the build process work smoothly.
